Module 5 Challenge - Data Visualization

This module challenged me in unexpected ways. I had to research (through the internet, Xpert Learning Assistant, and "Data Analysis with Python" books) a lot of functions to try to find a solution. In a lot of cases, it turned out that I was overcomplicating things.

1. Merge the two given csv files.
2. Clean up the data by finding the mouse with duplicate records.
    
    2a. Research how to use the duplicated function.
3. Calculate the summary statistics manually and with aggregate function.
    
    3a. Research aggregate function.
4. Use Pandas and pyplot to demonstrate understanding of how to show data in a bar chart.
5. Use Pandas and pyplot to demonstrate understanding of how to show data in a pie chart.

    5a. Unexpectedly got stuck here because I was trying to figure out how to narrow the data down to determine the gender of each mouse. Eventually, I figured it out (with the help of Xpert LA) only to discover that I didn't have to find the gender of each mouse to match the chart in the starter file.
6. Find the final tumor volume for each mouse in the list of drug regimens suggested.

    6a. Seems like hardcoding is necessary here.
